/**
 * Write a program that plays tic-tac-toe. The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3 Ã— 3 grid and is played by two players, who take turns.
 * The first player marks moves with a circle, the second with a cross. The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequence of three marks wins.
 * Your program should draw the game board, ask the user for the coordinates of the next mark, change the players after every successful move, and pronounce the winner.
